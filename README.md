# Communio.io - Twitter Clone using Flask, Bcrypt, and Psycopg2

Communio.io is a simple Twitter clone application built with Python Flask web framework, Bcrypt for password hashing and encryption, and Psycopg2 for PostgreSQL database interaction. The application allows users to create accounts, login, post messages, and comment on other users' posts. In the future, the application will also allow users to follow other users.

## Functionality

The application provides the following functionality:

- User authentication and authorization
- User account creation
- User login and logout
- Posting messages
- Commenting on messages (in the future)
- Following other users (in the future)

## Challenges

The biggest challenge in building this application was mapping out the relationships between routes and tables, and managing all the different technologies that were used. I had to design the database schema and map out the routes for the different functionalities, while also integrating Flask, Bcrypt, and Psycopg2 to ensure smooth functioning of the application. Additionally, managing and debugging errors with the interaction between these technologies was a time-consuming process.

Despite these challenges, I am pleased with the end result and look forward to continuing to develop and improve the application in the future.

## Usage

You can access the hosted version of the application at https://project2-myn5.onrender.com/

Upon accessing the application, you will be prompted to create an account or login if you already have one. Once you are logged in, you can create posts, view posts from other users, and comment on them.
